# Research Paper Q&A Assistant: Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Product Overview

The Research Paper Q&A Assistant is an AI-powered application designed to help researchers, students, and academics efficiently extract insights from scientific papers. By leveraging advanced natural language processing and retrieval techniques, the application enables users to ask questions about research papers and receive accurate, contextually relevant answers without having to read the entire document.

## Problem Statement

Researchers and students face significant challenges when trying to quickly understand and extract information from academic papers:

- **Information Overload**: The volume of published research is growing exponentially, making it impossible to thoroughly read every relevant paper
- **Time Constraints**: Researchers need to quickly extract key information from papers but lack efficient tools to do so
- **Complex Language**: Academic papers often use specialized terminology and complex sentence structures that can be difficult to parse
- **Cross-Referencing Challenges**: Understanding how findings relate to specific methodologies or data points within a paper requires significant cognitive effort
- **Limited Accessibility**: Traditional search methods within PDFs are keyword-based and miss semantic relationships

## Target Users

1. **Academic Researchers**: Professors, postdocs, and research scientists who need to quickly extract information from papers in their field
2. **Graduate Students**: Masters and PhD students conducting literature reviews or staying current with research
3. **Undergraduate Students**: Students working on research projects or trying to understand complex academic material
4. **Industry R&D Professionals**: Researchers in corporate settings who need to stay updated on academic advancements
5. **Journal Editors and Reviewers**: Professionals who need to efficiently assess research papers
6. **Research Librarians**: Information specialists who assist others in finding and understanding academic content

## User Stories
